We were not able to create the database schema using PHP and MySQL because we had issues connecting properly. 
However, we were able to connect using MySQL Workbench so you will see in _xgroup there is a full database 
schematic that we implemented using the queries from persistance.sql. The PHP code we've written for the getter 
and setter methods is missing the connection component but should work with the provided db schematic.
