We were not able to create the database schema using PHP and MySQL because we had issues connecting properly. However, we were able to connect using MySQL Workbench so you will see in _xgroup there is a full database schematic that we implemented using the queries from persistance.sql. The PHP code we've written for the getter and setter methods is missing the connection component but we've tested them on databases on our local machines so they do work.
